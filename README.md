# Simple Interest Calculator (Bash)

A simple calculator that computes **simple interest** given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

## Formula
Simple Interest (SI) = (p × r × t) / 100

Where:
- `p` = principal amount
- `r` = annual rate of interest (percent)
- `t` = time period in years

## Input
- p: principal amount
- r: annual rate (in percent)
- t: time (in years)

## Output
- Simple interest = (p * r * t) / 100
- The script prints the computed simple interest and the total amount (principal + interest).
